# Car-Tyre-Classification
# OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this deep learning model is to predict the rating of vehicle tyres based on various features such as model, tire brand, serial number, type, width, diameter, selling price, and original price.

By accurately predicting tire ratings, the model aims to assist consumers, retailers, and manufacturers in making informed decisions regarding tire quality and performance. 
 
This model uses a neural network architecture to classify tire ratings into multiple categories, optimizing the classification process through supervised learning on a preprocessed and scaled dataset.

The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy.
